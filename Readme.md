A mod to update the UI and features of Mask of Arcadius by using Liberation Day resources for an all around better viewing experience.

## Installation

Copy the contents of the `SunriderMoAEnhancement` folder inside the zip to `%INSTALLDIR%`, say yes when merging folders.

> Use of this mod requires that you own a copy of Sunrider: Liberation Day. Mask of Arcadius Enhancement Mod will not function unless you copy and rename `%LIBDAY%/game/archive.rpa` to `%MASKOFARCADIUS%/game/libday.rpa`. Any new name is valid, but it must **not** be `archive.rpa`, as this is used by the Denpasoft patch.

### Uninstallation

First remove the `%INSTALLDIR%/game/mods/eui` folder.

After uninstalling the mod, any saves creating during mod-use will be too large for the save window and stretch off the screen. To fix this, use the other supplied download: `SunriderMoAEnhancementRestore`. Copy the contents of the `SunriderMoAEnhancement` folder inside the zip to `%INSTALLDIR%`, say yes when merging folders. This is a fix that contains one file, the purpose is to overwrite the save screen with a copy that resizes the save thumbnails to stay inside the window.

## Features

* Improved dialogue text and names, using larger font and color-coded outlines.
* Quick Menu dropdown instead of the navigation bar in the bottom right of the screen.
* Larger Save window that is separated from the lLoad window, making them harder to mix up.
* Larger save screenshots making it easier to preview the scene.
* New less cramped Options window with 3 tabs instead of 2.
* New Bonus menu with the ability to add CG, Background, and Music viewing.
* New Yes/No prompt.
* History window for choice selection when starting a Mask of Arcadius campaign making choice selection much easier.
* An always-present background so that Alt+F4'ing or opening the developer console will not show a gray checkered background.
* Minor polish on the Main Menu selection, and you can now unselect the start option and hide the campaigns.
* Red highlight for active planets in the Galaxy Map.

## Known Bugs

* There are a few *very* wordy choices in the game, and there's probably no proper way to fit them into the choice box.

## For Another Project

* **Battle:** *Integrate a setting for Japanese voices.*
* **Battle:** *Add a setting for Liberation Day-style battle animations.*

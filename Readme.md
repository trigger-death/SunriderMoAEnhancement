# Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius Enhancement Mod

A mod to update the UI and features of Mask of Arcadius by using Liberation Day resources for an all around better viewing experience.

> Use of this mod requires that you own a copy of Sunrider: Liberation Day. Mask of Arcadius Enhancement will not function unless you copy and rename `%LIBDAY%/game/archive.rpa` to `%MASKOFARCADIUS%/game/libday.rpa`. Any new name is valid, but it must **not** be `archive.rpa`, as this is used by the Denpasoft patch.


## Features

* Improved dialogue text and names, using larger font and color-coded outlines.
* Quick Menu dropdown instead of the navigation bar in the bottom right of the screen.
* Larger Save window that is separated from the lLoad window, making them harder to mix up.
* Larger save screenshots making it easier to preview the scene.
* New less cramped Options window with 3 tabs instead of 2.
* New Bonus menu with the ability to add CG, Background, and Music viewing.
* New Yes/No prompt.
* History window for choice selection when starting a Mask of Arcadius campaign making choice selection much easier.
* An always-present background so that Alt+F4'ing or opening the developer console will not show a gray checkered background.
* Minor polish on the Main Menu selection, and you can now unselect the start option and hide the campaigns.


## Work in Progress

* **Bonus Window:** *Cleanup Deleted Scene/Addon Select display.*
* **Bonus Window:** *Add CG/Backgrounds/Music.*
* **Quick Menu:** *Lots of work needed to make sure this menu is shown and hidden at the appropriate times.*
* **Battle:** *Integrate a setting for Japanese voices.*
* **Battle:** *Add a setting for Liberation Day-style battle animations.*
* **Battle:** *Add Liberation Day-style improved battle interfaces.*
